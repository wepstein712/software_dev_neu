# The Not-So-Dumb Strategy

The Not-So-Dumb Strategy, NSDS uses a [first avoidance manuever](https://youtu.be/Doavo0DdzlE?t=58) for initial placement as well as intermediete moves. When it first plays, this strategy will play in the spot with the largest summed distance to the other players. For intermediete moves, each move is calculated based on how many tiles they would be next to in that new coordinate. It then chooses the [loneliest space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5ab8BOu4LE).
