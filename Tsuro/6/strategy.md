# The Lonely Strategy

The Lonely Strategy uses a first avoidance maneuver for initial placement as well as intermediate moves. When it first plays, this strategy will play in the spot with the largest summed distance to the other players. For intermediate moves, each move is calculated based on how many tiles they would be next to in that new coordinate. It then chooses the loneliest space.
